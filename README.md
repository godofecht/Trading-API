# Trading-API

This project implements a simple trading API built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The API allows clients to interact with products, place buy/sell orders, and track their portfolio and product balances over time. The API also supports transaction logging, fee calculations, and retrieving various metrics.

## Features

- **Client Management**: Keep track of client data including orders and transactions.
- **Product Management**: Manage products available for trading.
- **Order Management**: Record buy and sell orders for products by clients.
- **Portfolio Metrics**: Calculate key portfolio metrics including life-to-date fee notional, outstanding fee notional, and weighted average yield.
- **Transaction Tracking**: Retrieve historical transactions for clients and products.
- **Testing**: Includes automated tests for various endpoints.
